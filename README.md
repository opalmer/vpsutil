# vpsutil
A personal wrapper around various vps service provider APIs.  This mainly exists
for experimentation and so get the functionality I need without having to load
additional dependencies.

The code in this repository was written against Python 3.4.  It may
also work with Python 2.6+

# Usage
```console
> virtualenv -p python3.4 virtualenv
> . virtualenv/bin/activate

```
